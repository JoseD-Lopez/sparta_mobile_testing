Mobile Automation Testing with Android Studio IDE and Appium

Android Studio provided us with an Android Virtual Device (AVD) which is a configuration that defines the characteristics of a device that you want to simulate in the Android Emulator. In this case the Android phone was emulated.

Appium an open source HTTP server written in Node.js platform. Which is mainly used for cross-platform test automation as it can manage WebDriver sessions. Tests are written through Appium via JSON using Selenium WebDriver.

Appium acts as a wrapper that translates Selenium commands to Android commands, making the framework Selenium WebDriver compatible.
